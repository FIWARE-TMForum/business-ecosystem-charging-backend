# Business Ecosystem Charging Backend Docker Image

This repository contains the Docker image of the Business Ecosystem Charging Backend component of the FIWARE Business API Ecosystem GE.

You can build a docker image based on this Dockerfile. This image will contain an instance of the Business Ecosystem Charging Backend, exposing port `8006`. This requires that you have [docker](https://docs.docker.com/installation/) installed on your machine.

If you just want to have a Business Ecosystem Charging Backend instance running as quickly as possible jump to section *The Fastest Way*.

If you want to know what is behind the scenes of our container you can go ahead and read the build and run sections.

## The Fastest Way

The Business Ecosystem Charging Backend component uses a MongoDB container as database.
The  software can be configured using the standard `settings.py` file or the supported environment variables. For details of the different configuration
options, have a look at the [Business API Ecosystem Configuration Guide](https://business-api-ecosystem.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration-guide.html)

To run the Business Ecosystem Charging Backend, `docker compose` can be used. To do so, you can use the file `docker-compose.yml` provided with the source code or create a new one with the following content:

```
version: '3'
services:
    mongo:
        image: mongo:4.4
        ports:
            - 27017:27017
        volumes:
            - ./charging-data:/data/db

    charging:
        image: fiware/biz-ecosystem-charging-backend:master
        links:
            - mongo
        depends_on:
            - mongo
        ports:
            - 8006:8006
        volumes:
            - ./charging-bills:/business-ecosystem-charging-backend/src/media/bills
            - ./charging-assets:/business-ecosystem-charging-backend/src/media/assets

          - BAE_CB_MONGO_DB=charging_db
          # - BAE_CB_MONGO_USER=user
          # - BAE_CB_MONGO_PASS=passwd

          # ----- Roles Configuration -----
          - BAE_LP_OAUTH2_ADMIN_ROLE=admin
          - BAE_LP_OAUTH2_SELLER_ROLE=seller

          # - BAE_CB_EMAIL_USER=user
          # - BAE_CB_EMAIL_PASS=pass
          # - BAE_CB_EMAIL_SMTP_SERVER=smtp.server.com
          # - BAE_CB_EMAIL_SMTP_PORT=587

          - BAE_CB_VERIFY_REQUESTS=True  # Whether or not the BAE validates SSL certificates on requests to external components 

          # ----- Site configuration -----
          - BAE_SERVICE_HOST=https://store.lab.fiware.org/  # External URL used to access the BAE
          - BAE_CB_LOCAL_SITE=http://charging.docker:8006/  # Local URL of the charging backend

          # ----- APIs Conection config -----
          - BAE_CB_CATALOG=http://apis.docker:8080/DSProductCatalog
          - BAE_CB_INVENTORY=http://apis.docker:8080/DSProductInventory
          - BAE_CB_ORDERING=http://apis.docker:8080/DSProductOrdering
          - BAE_CB_BILLING=http://apis.docker:8080/DSBillingManagement
          - BAE_CB_RSS=http://rss.docker:8080/DSRevenueSharing
          - BAE_CB_USAGE=http://apis.docker:8080/DSUsageManagement
          - BAE_CB_AUTHORIZE_SERVICE=http://proxy.docker:8004/authorizeService/apiKeys
```

As you can see, the biz-ecosystem-charging-backend image defines 4 volumes. In particular:
* */business-ecosystem-charging-backend/src/media/bills*: This directory contains the PDF invoices generated by the Business Ecosystem Charging Backend
* */business-ecosystem-charging-backend/src/media/assets*: This directory contains the different digital assets uploaded by sellers to the Business Ecosystem Charging Backend
* */business-ecosystem-charging-backend/src/plugins*: This directory is used for providing asset plugins (see section *Installing Asset Plugins*)
* */business-ecosystem-charging-backend/src/wstore/asset_manager/resource_plugins/plugins*: This directory includes the code of the plugins already installed

It can be seen that the system can be configured with the environment variables defined by the software. In this case, providing the settings file is not mandatory, taking into account that the environment variables values override the file ones.

Once you have created the file, run the following command:

```
docker compose up
```

Then, the Business Ecosystem Charging Backend should be up and running in `http://YOUR_HOST:PORT/` replacing `YOUR_HOST` by the host of your machine and `PORT` by the port selected in the previous step.

Once the different containers are running, you can stop them using:

```
docker compose stop
```

And start them again using:

```
docker compose start
```

Additionally, you can terminate the different containers by executing:

```
docker compose down
```

## Build the image

If you have downloaded the [Business Ecosystem Charging Backend's source code](https://github.com/FIWARE-TMForum/business-ecosystem-charging-backend) you can build your own image. The end result will be the same, but this way you have a bit more of control of what's happening.

To create the image, just navigate to the `docker` directory and run:

    $ docker build -t biz-ecosystem-charging-backend -f docker/Dockerfile .


The parameter `-t biz-ecosystem-charging-backend` gives the image a name. This name could be anything, or even include an organization like `-t fiware/biz-ecosystem-charging-backend`. This name is later used to run the container based on the image.

If you want to know more about images and the building process you can find it in [Docker's documentation](https://docs.docker.com/userguide/dockerimages/).
    
## Installing Asset Plugins

As you may know, the Business API Ecosystem is able to sell different types of digital assets
by loading asset plugins in its Charging Backend. In this context, it is possible to install
asset plugins in the current Docker image as follows:

1) Copy the plugin file into the host directory of the volume */business-ecosystem-charging-backend/src/plugins*

2) Enter the running container:
```
docker exec -i -t your-container /bin/bash
```

3) Go to the installation directory
```
cd /business-ecosystem-charging-backend/src
```

4) Load the plugin
```
./manage.py loadplugin ./plugins/pluginfile.zip
```
